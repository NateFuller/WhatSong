# _**whatsong**_
The original concept for _**whatsong**_ is to look/feel like TikTok or IG Reels but with the goal of sharing personally recorded music. It's definitely not even close to being ready for use, but I revisit it here and there with the goal of learning something new as I tinker.

## Serverside Swift with Vapor
One thing I wanted to attempt during development of _**whatsong**_ was rolling my own back end service. I had been reading about [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) at the time so decided to give that a whirl. 

To see the implementation I've started using Vapor, check out the [WhatSong-Backend repository](https://github.com/NateFuller/WhatSong-Backend)
